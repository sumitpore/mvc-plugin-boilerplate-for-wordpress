		 * You may want to call this in constructor, if you feel hooks/filters
		 * callbacks should be registered when the new instance of the class
		 * is created.
		 *
		 * The purpose of this method is to set the convention that first place to
		 * find add_action/add_filter is register_hook_callbacks method.
		 *
		 * This method is not marked abstract because it may not be needed in every
		 * model. Making it abstract would enforce every child class to implement
		 * the method.
		 *
		 * If I were you, I would define register_hook_callbacks method in the child
		 * class when it is a 'Model only' route. This is not hard & fast rule, it
		 * is just my opinion when I would define this method.
